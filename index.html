            <h2>Background and Growth</h2>
            <p>
                 I was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 
                 and raised in a small town in the metropolitan region, 
                 where I enjoyed a peaceful childhood and adolescence. 
                 I grew up with my parents, sister, and cousin, in a close-knit 
                 family environment. Family has always played an important role 
                 in my life, and we continue to stay connected — we make a point
                  of catching up at least once a week. I also value strong friendships, 
                  which I maintain through daily interactions at work, university, 
                  and other activities throughout the week.
            </p>

        <div id="work-experience"> 
            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>
                 I currently work in the commercial service area of an insurance 
                 company and also take on freelance projects as a front-end developer. 
                 My primary goal is to transition fully into software development, 
                 where I can continue to grow and build a solid career as a software developer.

        <div id="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate about philosophy, art, film, and music. 
                In my free time, I enjoy reading about various thinkers, 
                watching movies and series, or spending quality time at 
                events with friends — especially electronic music parties, 
                which we all deeply enjoy. I also frequently go out with friends 
                and like to ride my bike around the city to take in the scenery.
